### Variational Autoencoders 

Autoencoders are neural networks designed to take an input and learn a compressed or intermediate representation of it, often called a "latent" representation. This intermediate representation captures the essential features of the input in a reduced form. The autoencoder then uses a decoder to reconstruct the original input from this latent representation. However, traditional autoencoders are generally deterministicâ€”they simply aim to reconstruct the input as accurately as possible without explicitly modeling the underlying data distribution.

Probabilistic Autoencoders, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), go a step further by introducing a probabilistic framework that allows them not only to reconstruct the input but also to generate new data. In this framework, the encoder and decoder are no longer deterministic mappings; instead, they represent probabilistic distributions. The encoder maps an input $$x$$ to a distribution over the latent space, encoding the input into a conditional distribution of latent variables, rather than a single point. The decoder then takes a sample from this latent distribution to produce a conditional distribution over possible reconstructions of $$x$$.

In probabilistic autoencoders, we can denote these conditional distributions as $$f$$ and $$g$$ for the encoder and decoder, respectively:

- $$f: P(h \mid x; W_f)$$, where $$h$$ is the latent representation conditioned on the input $$x$$, and $$W_f$$ are the parameters of the encoder. This distribution captures the probability of various representations $$h$$ given the input $$x$$.

- $$g: P(x \mid h; W_g)$$, where $$x$$ is reconstructed or generated from the latent representation $$h$$, with $$W_g$$ as the parameters of the decoder. This distribution captures the probability of the data $$x$$ given a particular latent representation $$h$$.


In essence, probabilistic autoencoders learn to model the distribution of the data in the latent space, which enables them to generate realistic, new examples by sampling from this distribution. This generative capability makes probabilistic autoencoders especially powerful for tasks such as data generation, anomaly detection, and representation learning.
